# Stack Overflow 2018 Annual Survey

## Introduction

**﻿**Stack Overflow is a question and answer site for professional and enthusiast programmers. It&#39;s built and run as part of the Stack Exchange network. Each month, over 50 million developers visit Stack Overflow to learn and share their knowledge.

## Description of the dataset

Over 100,000 developers took the 30-minute survey during January 2018. Top 5 sources of respondents were banner ads, email lists, house ads, blog posts, and Twitter. The resulting dataset consists of 129 variables and 98,855 qualified observations.

I chose this dataset because of a common interest Data Scientist share with Developers e.g. IDE&#39;s and programing languages, but after a short survey of the dataset I found that some of the respondents where Data Scientists and Machine Learning Specialists. In addition, some of the questions in the survey were related to Artificial Intelligence. Therefore, the focus of the analysis became to extract as much data as possible regarding the Data Science field and to compare the outcomes to all the respondents in this survey.

## Description of Analysis

#### 1. General Overview

As a general overview I wanted to find out the roles of the respondents who took part in the survey, and the most popular IDE&#39;s.

#### 2. Data Science

Despite the very small percentage of respondents who claimed to be Data Scientist and Machine Learning specialists, it was interesting to find out their preferred IDE&#39;s , countries from which most of the Data Scientist come from,  level of education, and the undergraduate major subject.

#### 3. Job Satisfaction and Future Expectations

In this section I tried to examine how satisfied Developers and Data Scientists in their jobs, what is the unemployment percentage based on this survey, and what are their future plans in the upcoming years.

#### 4. Artificial Intelligence

For the first time questions about Artificial Intelligence were introduced on the Stock Overflow survey. The goal of the question was to find out what developers think about AI, what are their future expectations, who should be responsible for the future development of AI, and what aspects of AI scares them the most.

# Conclusions

## General Overview

- Full-Stack and Back-End roles are the most popular amongst the respondents in the survey.
- Python and R Studio are the most popular IDE&#39;s amongst data scientists.
- Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Notepad++, and Sublime Text are the most popular amongst all the respondents in the survey.

## Data Science

- United States and India are the major contributors to data science.
- 40% of Data Scientists have master&#39;s degree with majors in Computer Science, Mathematics or Statistics.

## Job Satisfaction and Future Expectations

- Employment percent in Data Science was found to be 11% higher compared to all respondents.
- Unemployment percent (4-6%) was found to be similar to the unemployment percent in other fields.
- Both Data Scientists and Developers are moderately satisfied in their jobs and more than 60% are open to new opportunities and 15% are actively searching for a new job. Only 25% are in each group are not interested in a new opportunity.
- As for the near future (5 years), most of the respondents see them self in a different or more specialized role, or even as founders or co-founders of their own company.

## Artificial Intelligence

- Both Developers (73%) and Data Scientists (87%) are very optimistic about the possibilities that Artificial Intelligence offers.
- 28% of the respondents think that the government or another regulatory body should be responsible for the future development of AI, while 48% of the respondents think that developers of AI should be responsible for its future.
- As for the future dangers that AI might bring into our lives, a specific threat was not established in this survey since there was no agreement about what the main dangers of AI are.
